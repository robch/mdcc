If there are exactly that many, output a single line that says 'Yes.'... otherwise, output a single line that says 'No.'... If you output 'No.' you must also output exactly what you found, and why you think there are not exactly that many tests with names in the file analyzed. Remember, you must count the test that counts the number of tests as one of the tests."
