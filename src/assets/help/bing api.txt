MDX BING API

  The `--bing-api` option allows you to use the Bing Web Search API for web searches
  instead of UI automated scraping of Bing or Google search results (the default).

USAGE: mdx web search "TERMS" --bing-api [...]

SETUP

  To use the Bing Web Search API, you need to get an API key and endpoint from Microsoft. You can
  use the free tier, which allows for up to 3 requests per second and 1000 requests per month, or
  you can upgrade to a paid tier for more requests.

  Once you have created your resource, you can get your API key from the Azure portal on the Keys
  and Endpoint page. Using those values, you can set these two environment variables, either in
  the active shell or in a file called `.env` in the current directory.

    BING_SEARCH_V7_ENDPOINT=https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search
