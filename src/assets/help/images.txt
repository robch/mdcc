MDX IMAGES

  MDX can convert images to markdown by extracting a rich description and all visible text
  using Azure OpenAI's vision capabilities.

USAGE: mdx IMAGE_FILE1 [FILE2 [...]] [...]
   OR: mdx IMAGE_PATTERN1 [PATTERN2 [...]] [...]

SETUP

  To use the Azure OpenAI vision capabilities, you'll need to create and deploy a resource and
  vision compatible model in the Azure AI Foundry portal or using the Azure AI CLI.

    TRY: https://ai.azure.com/
     OR: https://thebookof.ai/setup/openai/

  Once you have created your resource and deployed a compatible model, you can get your API key
  from the Azure portal or using the `ai dev new .env` command. Using those values, you can set
  these environment variables, either in the active shell or in a file called `.env` in the
  current directory.
